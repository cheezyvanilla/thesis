## quantum based algorithm neural network
1. Why do we utilize qubit in this program? 
- In order to enhance the EA(evolutionary algorithm) of NN(neural network) in an efficient way, we utilize quantum system into the NN. In the conventional EA, the potentially ideal individual in the population probably will be deleted in early iteration. By this QANN, instead of deleting bad invidual, it modifies the qubit(quantum bit) in order to enhance the network.
